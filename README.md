#Customer Credit Underwriting Application Model
I utilized clustering algorithms in Python to analyze real-time GPS data from an app, identifying key locations such as home and office using density-based clustering techniques. This analysis allowed me to generate crucial indicators, including the distance between home and office, as well as behavioral insights, which were integrated into a credit application model.
